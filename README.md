# IsoTree

:evergreen_tree: [IsoTree](https://github.com/david-cortes/isotree) - outlier/anomaly detection for using Isolation Forest - for Ruby

Learn how [Isolation Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyFQXQf4w4w) works

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'isotree'
```

## Getting Started

Prep your data

```ruby
x = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]
```

Train a model

```ruby
model = IsoTree::IsolationForest.new
model.fit(x)
```

Get outlier scores

```ruby
model.predict(x)
```

Scores are between 0 and 1, with higher scores indicating outliers

## Parameters

Pass parameters - default values below

```ruby
IsoTree::IsolationForest.new(
  sample_size: nil,
  ntrees: 500,
  ndim: 3,
  ntry: 3,
  prob_pick_avg_gain: 0,
  prob_pick_pooled_gain: 0,
  prob_split_avg_gain: 0,
  prob_split_pooled_gain: 0,
  min_gain: 0,
  all_perm: false,
  coef_by_prop: false,
  sample_with_replacement: false,
  penalize_range: true,
  weigh_by_kurtosis: false,
  min_imp_obs: 3,
  random_seed: 1,
  nthreads: -1
)
```

See a [detailed explanation](https://isotree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#isotree.IsolationForest)

## Data

Data can be an array of arrays

```ruby
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```

Or a Numo array

```ruby
Numo::NArray.cast([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
```

## Performance

IsoTree uses OpenMP when possible for best performance. To enable OpenMP on Mac, run:

```sh
brew install libomp
```

Then reinstall the gem.
